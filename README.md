An AI Face Detector with Python is a computer vision application that automatically identifies and locates human faces in images or video streams. It uses OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) and pre-trained models like Haar Cascade Classifiers or Deep Learning models (DNN, CNNs) to detect facial features.

ðŸ”¹ How it works (basic steps):

Import OpenCV â†’ to handle image/video processing.

Load a Pre-trained Model â†’ e.g., haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml.

Capture Input â†’ from an image, video, or webcam.

Convert to Grayscale â†’ improves detection speed and accuracy.

Apply Face Detection â†’ using detectMultiScale() to locate faces.

Draw Bounding Boxes â†’ highlight detected faces in the frame.

ðŸ”¹ Applications:

Security systems (CCTV monitoring).

Attendance & access control.

Social media filters.

Human-computer interaction (HCI).

Emotion & smile detection (with additional classifiers).
